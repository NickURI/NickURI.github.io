    <h3> <p> Hello my name is Nick Rapoza, I am majoring in computer science and minoring in Film. <br>
        I plan on also getting a degree in cybersecurity because it's not only helpful but also very interesting to me. <br>
        I play soccer and plan on doing some sort of intermerial sport this year as well as participate in Greek Life. <br>
        Typically I'm always doing some sort of project, I normally spend my nights using things like photoshop and video editors. <br>
        I'm very excited to learn more skills in this class and I can't wait to see what I come up with. <br>
        
        </p></h3>

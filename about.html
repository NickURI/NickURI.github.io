     <h3> <p> Hello my name is Nick Rapoza, I am majoring in computer science and minoring in Film. 
        I plan on also getting a degree in cybersecurity because it's not only helpful but also very interesting to me.
        I play soccer and plan on doing some sort of intermerial sport this year as well as join a frat. 
        I'm very excited to learn more skills in this class and I have many ideas about different things to program.
